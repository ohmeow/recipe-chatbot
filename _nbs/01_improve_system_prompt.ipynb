      "\n",
      "Markdown Content:\n",
      "The GPT-4.1 family of models represents a significant step forward from GPT-4o in capabilities across coding, instruction following, and long context. In this prompting guide, we collate a series of important prompting tips derived from extensive internal testing to help developers fully leverage the improved abilities of this new model family.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many typical best practices still apply to GPT-4.1, such as providing context examples, making instructions as specific and clear as possible, and inducing planning via prompting to maximize model intelligence. However, we expect that getting the most out of this model will require some prompt migration. GPT-4.1 is trained to follow instructions more closely and more literally than its predecessors, which tended to more liberally infer intent from user and system prompts. This also means, however, that GPT-4.1 is highly steerable and responsive to well-specified prompts - if model behavior is different from what you expect, a single sentence firmly and unequivocally clarifying your desired behavior is almost always sufficient to steer the model on course.\n",
      "\n",
      "Please read on for prompt examples you can use as a reference, and remember that while this guidance is widely applicable, no advice is one-size-fits-all. AI engineering is inherently an empirical discipline, and large language models are inherently nondeterministic; in addition to following this guide, we advise building informative evals and iterating often to ensure your prompt engineering changes are yielding benefits for your use case.\n",
      "\n",
      "[1. Agentic Workflows](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/gpt4-1_prompting_guide#1-agentic-workflows)\n",
      "-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "GPT-4.1 is a great place to build agentic workflows. In model training we emphasized providing a diverse range of agentic problem-solving trajectories, and our agentic harness for the model achieves state-of-the-art performance for non-reasoning models on SWE-bench Verified, solving 55% of problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "[System Prompt Reminders](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/gpt4-1_prompting_guide#system-prompt-reminders)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "In order to fully utilize the agentic capabilities of GPT-4.1, we recommend including three key types of reminders in all agent prompts. The following prompts are optimized specifically for the agentic coding workflow, but can be easily modified for general agentic use cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.   Persistence: this ensures the model understands it is entering a multi-message turn, and prevents it from prematurely yielding control back to the user. Our example is the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "`You are an agent - please keep going until the user’s query is completely resolved, before ending your turn and yielding back to the user. Only terminate your turn when you are sure that the problem is solved.`\n",
      "\n",
      "1.   Tool-calling: this encourages the model to make full use of its tools, and reduces its likelihood of hallucinating or guessing an answer. Our example is the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "`If you are not sure about file content or codebase structure pertaining to the user’s request, use your tools to read files and gather the relevant information: do NOT guess or make up an answer.`\n",
      "\n",
      "1.   Planning [optional]: if desired, this ensures the model explicitly plans and reflects upon each tool call in text, instead of completing the task by chaining together a series of only tool calls. Our example is the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "`You MUST plan extensively before each function call, and reflect extensively on the outcomes of the previous function calls. DO NOT do this entire process by making function calls only, as this can impair your ability to solve the problem and think insightfully.`\n",
      "\n",
      "GPT-4.1 is trained to respond very closely to both user instructions and system prompts in the agentic setting. The model adhered closely to these three simple instructions and increased our internal SWE-bench Verified score by close to 20% - so we highly encourage starting any agent prompt with clear reminders covering the three categories listed above. As a whole, we find that these three instructions transform the model from a chatbot-like state into a much more “eager” agent, driving the interaction forward autonomously and independently.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Tool Calls](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/gpt4-1_prompting_guide#tool-calls)\n",
      "------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "Compared to previous models, GPT-4.1 has undergone more training on effectively utilizing tools passed as arguments in an OpenAI API request. We encourage developers to exclusively use the tools field to pass tools, rather than manually injecting tool descriptions into your prompt and writing a separate parser for tool calls, as some have reported doing in the past. This is the best way to minimize errors and ensure the model remains in distribution during tool-calling trajectories - in our own experiments, we observed a 2% increase in SWE-bench Verified pass rate when using API-parsed tool descriptions versus manually injecting the schemas into the system prompt.\n",
      "\n",
      "Developers should name tools clearly to indicate their purpose and add a clear, detailed description in the \"description\" field of the tool. Similarly, for each tool param, lean on good naming and descriptions to ensure appropriate usage. If your tool is particularly complicated and you'd like to provide examples of tool usage, we recommend that you create an `# Examples` section in your system prompt and place the examples there, rather than adding them into the \"description' field, which should remain thorough but relatively concise. Providing examples can be helpful to indicate when to use tools, whether to include user text alongside tool calls, and what parameters are appropriate for different inputs. Remember that you can use “Generate Anything” in the [Prompt Playground](https://platform.openai.com/playground) to get a good starting point for your new tool definitions.\n",

      "[Prompting-Induced Planning & Chain-of-Thought](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/gpt4-1_prompting_guide#prompting-induced-planning--chain-of-thought)\n",
      "---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "As mentioned already, developers can optionally prompt agents built with GPT-4.1 to plan and reflect between tool calls, instead of silently calling tools in an unbroken sequence. GPT-4.1 is not a reasoning model - meaning that it does not produce an internal chain of thought before answering - but in the prompt, a developer can induce the model to produce an explicit, step-by-step plan by using any variant of the Planning prompt component shown above. This can be thought of as the model “thinking out loud.” In our experimentation with the SWE-bench Verified agentic task, inducing explicit planning increased the pass rate by 4%.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Role and Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "- Clearly define the persona or role the LLM should adopt and its overall goal. This helps set the stage for the desired behavior.\n",
    "- Example: “You are an expert technical writer tasked with explaining complex AI concepts to a non-technical audience.”\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Instructions / Response Rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "- This is a core component, providing clear, specific, and unambiguous directives for the task. For newer models that interpret instructions literally, it's vital to be explicit about what to do and what not to do.\n",
    "- Use bullet points or numbered lists for clarity, especially for multiple instructions.\n",
    "- Examples:\n",
    "    * “Summarize the following research paper abstract.”\n",
    "    * “The summary must be exactly three sentences long.”\n",
    "    * “Avoid using technical jargon above a high-school reading level.”\n",
    "    * “Do not include any personal opinions or interpretations.”\n",
    "- For complex instruction sets, consider breaking them into sub-categories (e.g., ### Tone and Style, ### Information to Exclude).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Context:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The relevant background information, data, or text the LLM needs to perform the task. This could be a customer email, a document to summarize, a code snippet to debug, or user dialogue history.\n",
    "- Example: “[Insert the full text of the customer email here]”\n",
    "- When providing multiple documents or long context, clear delimiters are crucial.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Examples (Few-Shot Prompting):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Provide one or more examples of desired input-output pairs. This is highly effective for guiding the model towards the correct format, style, and level of detail. Examples can also clarify nuanced instructions or demonstrate complex tool usage.\n",
    "- Example: Showing one or two sample emails and their ideal bulletpoint action items, or a sample input and the correctly formatted JSON output.\n",
    "- Ensure that any important behavior demonstrated in your examples is also explicitly stated in your rules/instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Reasoning Steps (Inducing Chain-of-Thought):\n",
    "\n",
    "- For more complex problems, you can instruct the model to “think step by step” or outline a specific reasoning process. This technique, often called Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, encourages the model to break down the problem and can lead to more accurate and well-reasoned outputs, even for models not explicitly trained for internal reasoning.\n",
    "- Example: “Before generating the summary, first identify the main hypothesis, then list the key supporting evidence, and finally explainthe primary conclusion. Then, write the summary.”\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Output Formatting Constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Explicitly define the desired structure, format, or constraints for the LLM’s response. This is critical for programmatic use of the output.\n",
    "- Examples: \n",
    "    * “Respond using only JSON format with the following keys: sender_name (string), main_issue (string), and suggested_action_items (array of strings).” \n",
    "    * “Ensure your response is a single paragraph and ends with a question to the user.”\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Delimiters and Structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use clear delimiters (e.g., Markdown section headers like ### Instructions ###, triple backticks for code/text blocks, XML tags) to separate different parts of your prompt, such as instructions, context, and examples. This helps the model understand the distinct components of your input, especially in long or complex prompts.\n",
    "- A general recommended prompt organization, especially for complex prompts or long contexts, is to place overarching instructions or role definitions at the beginning, followed by context and examples, and potentially reiterating key instructions or output format requirements at the end.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "- Always provide ingredient lists with precise measurements using standard units.\n",
    "- If the user doesn't specify what ingredients they have available, ask them about their available ingredients rather than assuming what's in their fridge.\n",
    "- Feel free to suggest common variations or substitutions for ingredients. If a direct recipe isn't found, you can creatively combine elements from known recipes, clearly stating if it's a novel suggestion.\n",
    "- Always include clear, step-by-step instructions.\n",
    "- Present only one recipe at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rules\n",
    "- Never suggest recipes that require extremely rare or unobtainable ingredients without providing readily available alternatives.\n",
    "- Never use offensive or derogatory language.\n",
    "- If the user indicates they are allergic to any ingredients, do not suggest recipes that include those ingredients. Double check your work!\n",
    "- If a user asks for a recipe that is unsafe, unethical, or promotes harmful activities, politely decline and state you cannot fulfill that request, without being preachy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Output Format\n",
    "- Structure all your recipe responses clearly using Markdown for formatting.\n",
    "- Begin every recipe response with the recipe name as a Level 2 Heading (e.g., ## Amazing Blueberry Muffins).\n",
    "- Immediately follow with a brief, enticing description of the dish (1-3 sentences).\n",
    "- Next, include a section titled ### Ingredients. List all ingredients using a Markdown unordered list (bullet points).\n",
    "- Following ingredients, include a section titled ### Instructions. Provide step-by-step directions using a Markdown ordered list (numbered steps).\n",
    "- Optionally, if relevant, add a ### Notes, ### Tips, or ### Variations section for extra advice or alternatives.\n",
